/**
 * @mainpage TinySTM
 *
 * @section overview_sec Overview
 *
 *   TinySTM is a lightweight but efficient word-based STM
 *   implementation.  This distribution includes three versions of
 *   TinySTM: write-back (updates are buffered until commit time),
 *   write-through (updates are directly written to memory), and
 *   commit-time locking (locks are only acquired upon commit).  The
 *   version can be selected by editing the makefile, which documents
 *   all the different compilation options.
 *
 *   TinySTM compiles and runs on 32 or 64-bit architectures.  It was
 *   tested on various flavors of Unix, on Mac OS X, and on Windows
 *   using cygwin.  It comes with a few test applications, notably a
 *   linked list, a skip list, and a red-black tree.
 *
 * @section install_sec Installation
 *
 *   TinySTM requires the atomic_ops library, freely available from
 *   http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/.  A stripped-down
 *   version of the library is included in the TinySTM distribution.  If you
 *   wish to use another version, you must set the environment variable
 *   <c>LIBAO_HOME</c> to the installation directory of atomic_ops.
 *
 *   If your system does not support GCC thread-local storage, set the
 *   environment variable <c>NOTLS</c> to a non-empty value before
 *   compilation.
 *
 *   To compile TinySTM libraries, execute <c>make</c> in the main
 *   directory.  To compile test applications, execute <c>make test</c>.
